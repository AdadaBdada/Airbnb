## Project Motivation
Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the Boston Airbnb datasets were collected and investigated. Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

- What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston? By how much do prices spike?
- Can we use other listing information to predict the housing price?
- The vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?

## File Description
